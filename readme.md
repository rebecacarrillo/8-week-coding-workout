# 8 week coding program! This repo contains exercise, documentation, schedules and pre-made workout sessions designed to 
	- build muscle memory
	- increase your command line confidence
	- grow your software engineering trade skills while exposing you to important fundamental concepts in CS, Data Structures, and Algorithm Design.

This program was developed for my love, Juan Pena.

@ To-Do: add and fill in the following sections
 
## 0  Quick Start
## 1 Bash Basics (Actually zsh but shhh)
## 2 Git Basics
## 3 Write Python code and Follow along with the video stream
## 4 Let's Learn Conditionals and Operators
## 5 HTTP Server
## 6 Object Oriented Programming
## 7 CI/CD -- Deploy with me!
## Develop an interest: where are we heading next? Backend, Frontend, Web Design, Game Design, Data Science, Dev Ops? The world is your oyster!


At every stage in this program, it is important to visit your flashcards and do your coding workouts. Every day, try to tackle a few problems in the "master your syntax" land.

Mastering syntax will make your logical flow so much better. Before we dive super deep into stuff like system design, algorithms, scripting, API design, etc etc --  we need to have incredible confidence in our ability to master syntax. 

I am a firm believer that boss-ass command line skills combined with boss ass syntax skills make an extremely fluent and confident code. My mission in this is to create a coder out of Juan who is as confident, helpful, and amazing as my partner is at sports and exercise and his own trade. 

Te Quiero Mucho Papi

I love you Juan
