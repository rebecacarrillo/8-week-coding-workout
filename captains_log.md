# Captain's Log, star date May 4th, 2024

(yes I know that's not the real star date today lmao)

Today I found very useful shortcuts and hotkeys, which I would like to document here.

 - to go to the end of the line in bash: we do CTRL-e. We do CTRL-a to get to the beginning
 - figured out how to set up my terminal such that I can do a google query from my terminal and felt like such a boss.

over the next few work sessions on this I'm gonna try to have the discipline to look up the solution to a hot-key related pain point any time I find myself being frustrated about having to switch windows and possibly lose focus, you know?

"the key to goodness is sustainability" < -- I agree with this.

I think this totally helps me study for technicals and for goals.
