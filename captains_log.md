# Captain's Log, star date May 4th, 2024

(yes I know that's not the real star date today lmao)

Today I found very useful shortcuts and hotkeys, which I would like to document here.

 - to go to the end of the line in bash: we do CTRL-e. We do CTRL-a to get to the beginning
 - figured out how to set up my terminal such that I can do a google query from my terminal and felt like such a boss.

over the next few work sessions on this I'm gonna try to have the discipline to look up the solution to a hot-key related pain point any time I find myself being frustrated about having to switch windows and possibly lose focus, you know?

"the key to goodness is sustainability" < -- I agree with this.

I think this totally helps me study for technicals and for goals.

Star date May 5th


I think I need more of platform or opportunity to explore this concept of optimizing for human-readable, logic maintanable stuff.

I wonder if I should apply for a grant or something. That would be pretty interesting. 

Yo, tonight, let's finish "you've got mail". 

I find those 90's movies so comforting and interesting 
because I love seeing the kind of thing my parents would have loved at my age. 

I fucking love seeing anything that reminds of what my antepasados went through.

Okay, action items: 

	[] learn more about obsidian
	[] read through the features of iTerm
	[x] log into threads on my laptop so I can encourage my brain and body to transition to desktop mode in the morning.

Wow, does opening a git diff actually open a vim window?


Start Date may 6th

I still really want to continue diving into a terminal-first mindset, but I need to kind of come up with a hello world example for Juan to rep out

I want to do this in a jupyter notebook probably, that's the easiest thing in my opinion.

Ugh somehow installing a theme seems to have broken juptyer, so that sucks. I should probably uninstall it. Do that tomorrow
